                                    experiences. We
                                    understand that circumstances may arise that require you to cancel your enrollment
                                    in our
                                    courses or mentorship programs. This Cancellation and Refund Policy outlines the

                                    under which we will process cancellations and refunds.</p>

                                    eligibility for a refund and the amount of the refund will depend on the timing of
                                    your
                                    cancellation and the specific terms of the course or program you enrolled in.</p>
