                        <p>Health insurance plans come in many shapes and sizes, but they typically fall into a few main categories:</p>
                         <ul class="list-unstyled">
						    <li class="mb-3">
						        <b class="text-primary">Health Maintenance Organization (HMO):</b>
						        <p class="small mb-0">Requires members to choose a primary care physician (PCP) and get referrals to see specialists. Generally, HMO plans have lower premiums and out-of-pocket costs but less flexibility in choosing healthcare providers.</p>
						    </li>
						    <li class="mb-3">
						        <b class="text-primary">Preferred Provider Organization (PPO):</b>
						        <p class="small mb-0">Offers more flexibility in choosing healthcare providers and does not require referrals to see specialists. However, premiums and out-of-pocket costs tend to be higher than HMO plans.</p>
						    </li>
						    <li class="mb-3">
						        <b class="text-primary">Exclusive Provider Organization (EPO):</b>
						        <p class="small mb-0">Similar to PPOs but does not cover any out-of-network care except in emergencies. EPOs usually have lower premiums than PPOs but come with less flexibility.</p>
						    </li>
						    <li class="mb-3">
						        <b class="text-primary">Point of Service (POS):</b>
						        <p class="small mb-0">Combines features of HMO and PPO plans, requiring members to choose a primary care physician while allowing some out-of-network coverage at a higher cost.</p>
						    </li>
						    <li class="mb-3">
						        <b class="text-primary">High Deductible Health Plans (HDHPs):</b>
						        <p class="small mb-0">These plans feature lower premiums but higher deductibles. They are often paired with Health Savings Accounts (HSAs) that allow you to save money tax-free for medical expenses.</p>
						    </li>
						    <li class="mb-3">
						        <b class="text-primary">UHL Health Plan:</b>
						        <p class="small mb-0">UHL offers various health insurance plans tailored to the needs of individuals and families.
